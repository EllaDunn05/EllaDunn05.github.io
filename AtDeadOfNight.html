    <h2>Development And Community</h2>
    <p>One intriguing theory commonly surrounding "At Dead of Night" revolves around the concept of parallel dimensions. According to this subreddit theory, the haunted hotel in the game serves as a portal or intersection point between different dimensions, each representing a unique timeline or reality. As players delve deeper into the mysteries of the hotel, they begin to uncover hints and clues that suggest the presence of alternate versions of characters and events. The shifting nature of the hotel's layout, combined with the eerie occurrences and ghostly apparitions, further support this idea. It is speculated that the protagonist's actions and choices throughout the game may influence which dimension they ultimately inhabit or even alter the course of events in different timelines.
